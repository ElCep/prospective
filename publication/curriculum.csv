L'Europe se taille la part du lion dans la production mondiale, avec l'Italie, la France et l'Espagne dans le trio de tête des pays producteurs. Mais ces données masquent des réalités spatiales très hétérogènes. En effet les différentes régions, AOC, ou IGP n'accèdent pas de la même manière au marché globalisé (Rouvellac et al., 2012 ; Schirmer, 2007). Les stratégies de la filière de manière générale (Chiffoleau et al., 2001; Touzard et al., 2008) et des viticulteurs en particulier (Touzard et al., 2003) sont déterminantes quant aux dynamiques territoriales qui peuvent se mettre en place (Bertrand and Bertrand, 2002 ; Gumuchian and Pecqueur, 2007). Dans ce contexte, on observe depuis une dizaine d'années, une grande diversité de dynamiques locales, allant de la relance de vignobles, à des réorientations individuelles ou collectives de la production sur des territoires déjà largement structurés par le vignoble (Hinnewinkel, 2007, 2004). Ces innovations ou modernisations des territoires (Touzard et al., 2003) résultent de la combinaison d'un grand nombre de facteurs locaux, régionaux et/ou nationaux, qui trouvent des résonances localement. Nous proposons ici d'explorer les conditions d'émergence (Gilbert and Troitzsch, 2005) et de diffusion des innovations sur les territoires viticoles, ainsi que la manière dont elles permettent de faire terroir et territoire. En nous basant sur différents territoires d'étude (AOC Banyuls Collioure, diffusion des pratiques biodynamiques dans la vallée du Rhône...), nous avons formalisé et construit un premier modèle informatique distribué dont nous proposons ici l'analyse et la discussion de quelques résultats. Nous présenterons donc un modèle multi-agents théorique (Ferber 1995, Epstein and Axtell, 1996), qui nous permettra d'explorer un très grand nombre de configurations qui seront mises au regard d'exemples viticoles issus de nos territoires d'étude. Nous exposerons ici les premiers résultats d'une démarche de recherche conjointe de deux doctorants.","2014-06-19","2014-08-11 08:39:31","2017-11-04 12:41:47","2014-08-11 08:39:31","1-13","","","","","","","","","","","","Toulouse","","","","","","hal.archives-ouvertes.fr","","C-ACTN","","; ","http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/docs/01/05/43/74/PDF/Delay_Marcelin_Toulouse_innov.pdf; http://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/index.php?action_todo=search&view_this_doc=hal-01054374&version=1&halsid=d6b6tq52cipb5drcifb2s73ha7","","Innovation; pente; SMA; système multi-agents; viticulture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Vin, innovation et mondialisation : enjeux et perspectives","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Yet in the current context of climate change, in which we turn to genetics, irrigation or innovation in cultural practices to maintain production quality, could the mountain environment emerge as a solution for adapting to climate change in vine-growing? Here we explore the role of cooperative policies that may be deployed on the territorial scale, using an agent-based model. Our model was based on the viticulture of the Banyuls–Collioures AOC area, which is characterized by small-scale vine-growers and marked by widespread involvement in cooperative systems. The simulation results showed an important role of cooperative policies not only to conserve narrow production window and required vine quality, but also in respect of the emblematic landscape structure. These results should foster vine-growers to strengthen their cooperatives and adequately use these organizations to mitigate future climate change impacts.","2015-11","2015-05-26 20:09:16","2017-11-04 12:41:54","2015-05-26 20:09:16","51-62","","","48","","Land Use Policy","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","ACL","","; ","http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837715001489/pdfft?md5=aff3c5c690695a25fb10e39c5dec6ea7&pid=1-s2.0-S0264837715001489-main.pdf; http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0264837715001489#","","Agent based modeling; Climate change; Landscape; viticulture","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

The wine cooperative system in vineyards in mountain regions, such as in Banyuls-sur-Mer, France and the Val di Cembra, Italy, offers a privileged context for studying the opportunities for individual action that affect precarious socio-economic balances. To understand, and sometimes predict, changes in the socio-economics and landscapes of a region due to cooperatives, we have used a multi-agent system (MAS) to model the behavior of the actors involved in wine production in a cooperative. This model analyses cooperative systems’ impact on socio-economic factors (income inequality and the rate of business failure) and landscapes (percentage of total land as vineyards, particularly in steep areas) of the regions considered. The findings show that cooperatives play a role of socio-economic and landscape stabilizer in these regions","2015-05-30","2015-05-27 08:48:50","2017-11-04 12:39:46","2015-05-27 08:48:50","","","","","","","The Cooperative","","","","","","Paris","en","","","","","halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr","","C-AFF","","","https://halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr/halshs-01155666v1","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","ICA Research International Conference","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

En fonction du degré d’enclavement des zones concernées par l’étude, mais aussi des espèces botaniques accessibles et des pratiques culturelles et culturales locales qui leur sont associées, l’arbre sera utilisé (ou non) dans son intégralité (et peut-être différemment) par les hommes ou leurs troupeaux. Cette dépendance critique met l’ensemble des services écosystémiques liés aux arbres en tension et mieux comprendre la place qu’occupe l’arbre dans l’espace perçu et l’espace vécu des populations sahéliennes devient un facteur clef la gestion des ressources naturelles et plus particulièrement pour les stratégies de reboisement lancé dans le cadre de la grande muraille verte au Sénégal. Cette meilleure compréhension constitue également un des éléments clés de l’accroissement de résilience socio-environnementale dans une zone où cette végétation est fortement dégradée par le surpâturage et où la ressource végétale bien exploitée et valorisée pourrait beaucoup mieux pouvoir qu’actuellement au bien-être des populations et à leur résilience économique. Pour comprendre et explorer la manière dont les acteurs perçoivent les ressources liées aux arbres et la manière dont ils les mobilisent individuellement ou collectivement, un travail de recherche en cours. Réalisé par Khoudia Niang, ethnobotaniste et écologue, et animé par Deborah Goffner, il vise à mettre en évidence les relations et les types d’utilisation que les acteurs ont avec les arbres dans des systèmes socio-ecologiques contrastés situés sur le tracé de la Grande Muraille Verte (GMV). Ce travail prend la forme d’une enquête par questionnaires complétée d’entretiens en focus-groups. Il conduira à l’élaboration et à la formalisation d’une cartographie des « éco-socio-patches » basée sur les techniques de l’écologie du paysage et réalisée avec le concours de Jean-Luc Peiry, et à l’élaboration d’un modèle informatique individus-centrés, réalisé par Etienne Delay. Ces formalisations (spatiales et comportementales) au sein d’un modèle spatialement explicite permettront d’alimenter des ateliers participatifs avec les acteurs locaux durant lesquels le modèle sera confronté, validé, ou infirmé par les acteurs dans une approche itérative visant à traduire de manière acceptable les dynamiques spatio-temporelles qui sont à l’œuvre sur le tracé de la GMV. L’exploration du système, menée conjointement par entretiens et questionnaires et combinée avec un formalisme à base d’agents dans une approche participative, nous permettra d’explorer deux facettes de la perception des arbres en milieux sahéliens : i) identifier la manière dont les populations locales perçoivent les changements dans leur environnement et les répercussions que cela a sur leurs pratiques ii) projeter dans le temps ces changements de pratiques pour évaluer leurs impacts sur le système sahélien. Dans ce travail nous nous inscrivons dans une approche conceptuelle où l’événement social est le produit, du comportement d’un agrégat d’individus (individualisme méthodologique) et nous aurons abondamment recours aux sciences de la complexité (analyse des émergences, modélisation individu-centré).","2017-05-08","2017-06-20 09:02:38","2017-11-04 12:44:27","2017-06-20 09:02:38","","","","","","","","","","","","","Aveiro (Portugal)","fr","","","","","halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr","","C-COM","","/home/delaye/.mozilla/firefox/3d7brbzt.default/zotero/storage/F5SWJM4J/halshs-01521743v1.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","Séminaire LabEX DRIIHM","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

Good management of this risk requires understanding the need for a trade-off between occupant safety, attractiveness of the island, environmental development, costs minimisation and population satisfaction. But such a trade-off can be difficult to find and to understand, for both decision makers and the population. SPRITE is a serious game aiming to answer this problem by placing the player in the role of a decision maker and letting them explore various (more or less balanced) policies. The knowledge gained from playing SPRITE can benefit both decision makers, enabling them to make more informed decisions, and residents, helping them to understand the issues involved in territory management.","2016-10-26","2017-06-20 09:06:19","2017-11-04 12:34:55","2017-06-20 09:06:19","33-46","","","","","","","","","","","Springer, Cham","","en","","","","","link.springer.com","","C-ACTI","","/home/delaye/.mozilla/firefox/3d7brbzt.default/zotero/storage/89KMN7N9/978-3-319-47093-1_4.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","International Conference on Information Systems for Crisis Response and Management in Mediterranean Countries","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""

In partnership with the local administration of Oléron Island in France, a participatory simulation model was developed to foster social learning about coastal risk prevention measures with local authorities and managers. This simulation integrates a coastal flooding model and a spatially explicit agent-based model that simulates the development of the area and the management of prevention measures. The participatory set-up includes an immersive environment for participants to remember the coastal flooding simulation displayed and a role game mechanism that simulates the coordination issues between the different decision bodies involved in coastal risk management. A first application proved that participants learn about the water expansion dynamics during flood events and the effects of building, raising and restoring dikes.","2017-12","2017-09-19 07:48:40","2017-11-04 12:35:21","2017-09-19 07:48:40","1-11","","","98","","Environmental Modelling & Software","","","","","","","","","","","","","ScienceDirect","","ACL","","/home/delaye/.mozilla/firefox/3d7brbzt.default/zotero/storage/VX3W2SUG/S1364815216310477.html","","","Coastal flooding; Participatory simulation; Risk management; Social learning","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
"GGZIUGCH","conferencePaper","2017","Delay, Etienne; Maraud, Simon","Questioning capitalistic power structures: a way to reconnect stakeholders with the land?","","","","","https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-01617308","From our different research fields, by comparing the relationships between local populations and their territory, we noted some similarities. This paper aims to analyze the relationship between local or indigenous stakeholders and their territory. We thus wondered on the possibilities to create a common framework to represent social dynamics of human groups regarding their management of natural resources. We focus on the evolution of collective behaviors in space and time and process of domination which tend to create a gap between human and their land. Capitalistic colonialism has considerably changed the territorial visions and practices of the people. Philosophical conception of the natural philosophy has shifted from the dependence on the land and resources to a domination of Nature (Gregory, 2001; Kaika 2005; Linton 2010). New centralized power structures appeared legitimizing and promoting the implementation of capitalistic lecture of the territory. In the South of France, the farmers have modified their agricultural practices since the creation of Vinça Dam; in Northern Sweden (or Swedish Sápmi), the Sami are fighting to be part of the management of their ancestral land; The Eeyou Istchee Cree, in Quebec, are now in possession of a capital by integrating neoliberal development; in Senegal, the Peuls are experiencing the impacts of sedentarization because of the construction of bore wholes by the State. In order to highlight these mechanisms in our four study cases, we tried to create a framework called TerritOry-Resources-Societal-Organization (TORSO). From anarchist authors, as Kropotkin, Bookchin and MacDonald, we tried to identify different spatio-temporal trajectories of societal reorganization regarding the management of resources. Then, it is possible to understand how the need of resource will influence the social relationships and how it evolves in time depending on the stakeholders in power. Determining the management structures trajectories and their dynamic evolutions doesn’t mean to create a universal law for a societal trend. The idea is to decode the elements which make the shift from a form of organization to another for a structure, and that we can amplify or counteract.","2017-09-21","2017-10-31 17:37:01","2017-11-04 12:41:31","2017-10-31 17:37:01","","","","","","","Questioning capitalistic power structures","","","","","","","en","","","","","halshs.archives-ouvertes.fr","","C-COM","","/home/delaye/.mozilla/firefox/3d7brbzt.default/zotero/storage/88EXE3ST/hal-01617308v1.html","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","","1st International Conference of Anarchist Geographies and Geographers (ICAGG) – Geography, social change and antiauthoritarian practices","","","","","","","","","","","","","","",""
